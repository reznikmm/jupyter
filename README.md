Jupyter Kernel and Client API in Ada
====================================

[![Copr build status](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/reznik/ada/package/jupyter-ada/status_image/last_build.png)](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/reznik/ada/)

This is repositoru contains
[Jupyter Client API](https://jupyter-client.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html)
binding and Ada Kernel written in Ada.

## Install
### Using [alire](https://alire.ada.dev)

    alr get --build jupyter_kernel
    cd jupyter_kernel*
    LIBRARY_TYPE=relocatable \
      JUPYTER_PATH=$PWD jupyter-notebook --debug

### Build from sources
Unpack source and run `make`.

### Dependencies
It depends on
 * [GNAT](https://www.adacore.com/download/more) Ada compiler and `gprbuild` tool
 * [Matreshka](https://forge.ada-ru.org/matreshka) library
 * [ZeroMQ-Ada](https://github.com/persan/zeromq-Ada) binding to zeromq
 * [Spawn](https://github.com/AdaCore/spawn) - a process launch library
 * [Alire](https://alire.ada.dev/) package manager (optional)

For now the Ada Kernel runs on Linux and Mac OS X (not tested) only, because it uses `dlopen` to load shared
libraries.

## Usage
Run `make` to build the library and examples. Then run jupyter-notebook:

```
JUPYTER_PATH=$PWD jupyter-notebook --debug
```

Now you can open a notebook file, for example `tests/Hello_Ada.ipynb`.
If you are going to use `alr` make sure to set `LIBRARY_TYPE=relocatable` environment
variable to force `alr` build projects as shared libraries.
